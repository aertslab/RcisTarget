Description: RcisTarget identifies transcription factor binding
    motifs (TFBS) over-represented on a gene list.
    In a first step, RcisTarget selects DNA motifs that are significantly 
    over-represented in the surroundings of the transcription start site (TSS) 
    of the genes in the gene-set. 
    This is achieved by using a database that contains genome-wide cross-species 
    rankings for each motif. The motifs that are then annotated to TFs and those
    that have a high Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) are retained. 
    Finally, for each motif and gene-set, 
    RcisTarget predicts the candidate target genes 
    (i.e. genes in the gene-set that are ranked above the leading edge).
