## Database server temporarily down

We have set up a temporary mirror for the motif databases at [http://bokeh.aertslab.org/cistarget/](http://bokeh.aertslab.org/cistarget/) (and motif annotation: [http://bokeh.aertslab.org/cistarget/motif2tf/](http://bokeh.aertslab.org/cistarget/motif2tf/)). 

Sorry for the inconvenience!

# RcisTarget
RcisTarget is an R-package to identify transcription factor (TF) binding motifs over-represented on a gene list. 

*Availability*: 

- The newest stable version of RcisTarget is available in *[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/RcisTarget)*. 
The package also contains a **tutorial** [(vignette)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/RcisTarget/inst/doc/RcisTarget.html) with information on how to run RcisTarget and how to interprete its results.

- This Github repository is meant mostly for development. "Use at your own risk" :-). Developers are welcome to contribute.
