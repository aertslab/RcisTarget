# RcisTarget
RcisTarget is an R-package to identify transcription factor (TF) binding motifs over-represented on a gene list. 

*Availability*: 

- The newest stable version of RcisTarget is available in *[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/RcisTarget)*. 
Unless it is for using with SCENIC, we recommend to install RcisTarget from Bioconductor.
The package also contains a **tutorial** [(vignette)](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/RcisTarget/inst/doc/RcisTarget.html) with information on how to run RcisTarget and how to interprete its results.

- **SCENIC** (v 0.1.5) requires [RcisTarget 0.99.0](http://scenic.aertslab.org/downloads/Rpackages/RcisTarget_0.99.0.tar.gz). More details on how to install this specific version are provided in SCENIC tutorial. 
*(Using newer versions might result in errors related to missing functions/classes, as some of these have been renamed).*
The update of SCENIC to use RcisTarget 1.0 is coming soon.

- This Github repository is meant mostly for development. "Use at your own risk" :-). Developers are welcome to contribute.
